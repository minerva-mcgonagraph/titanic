        "On April 10, 1912 the unsinkable Titanic set sail on her maiden voyage. But we all know the story from here. Too-fast speeds, drifting icebergs, and possibly some fire damage led the Titanic to the bottom of the ocean five days later. A lack of lifeboats, which were only ever meant to ferry passengers to a rescue ship, unseasonably frigid waters, and the inaction of a nearby ship led to the deaths of two-thirds of those aboard. What was left was a passenger manifest, each row with a cruel label: 1 for Survived and 0 for Did Not Survive. "
